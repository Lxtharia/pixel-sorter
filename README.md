# PixelSorter

My try on using Java Swing to build an application to make pixelsorting any picture as easy as possible! 

Created using Processing (processing.org) and with the help of ASDFPixelSort (https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort/) which helped me understand how it works.


## Things to note:

- The Brightness and BlackWhite Selectors seem very similar, but i swear, they are different! (I just don't know how exactly)
- The Java File Selector is horrid, I'm sorry
- The "Save As" Button is currently just decoration (it doesn't work yet)
